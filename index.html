<p>Bee Movie
</p><p>By Jerry Seinfeld
</p><p>
</p><p>NARRATOR:
</p><p>(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
</p><p>According to all known laws
</p><p>of aviation,
</p><p> :
</p><p>there is no way a bee
</p><p>should be able to fly.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Its wings are too small to get
</p><p>its fat little body off the ground.
</p><p> :
</p><p>The bee, of course, flies anyway
</p><p> :
</p><p>because bees don't care
</p><p>what humans think is impossible.
</p><p>BARRY BENSON:
</p><p>(Barry is picking out a shirt)
</p><p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
</p><p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Ooh, black and yellow!
</p><p>Let's shake it up a little.
</p><p>JANET BENSON:
</p><p>Barry! Breakfast is ready!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Coming!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Hang on a second.
</p><p>(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Hello?
</p><p>ADAM FLAYMAN:
</p><p>
</p><p>(Through phone)
</p><p>- Barry?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Adam?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Can you believe this is happening?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I can't. I'll pick you up.
</p><p>(Barry flies down the stairs)
</p><p> :
</p><p>MARTIN BENSON:
</p><p>Looking sharp.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>Use the stairs. Your father
</p><p>paid good money for those.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Sorry. I'm excited.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>Here's the graduate.
</p><p>We're very proud of you, son.
</p><p> :
</p><p>A perfect report card, all B's.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>Very proud.
</p><p>(Rubs Barry's hair)
</p><p>BARRY=
</p><p>Ma! I got a thing going here.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- You got lint on your fuzz.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Ow! That's me!
</p><p>
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
</p><p>- Bye!
</p><p>(Barry flies out the door)
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>Barry, I told you,
</p><p>stop flying in the house!
</p><p>(Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
</p><p>newspaper)
</p><p>BARRY==
</p><p>- Hey, Adam.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Hey, Barry.
</p><p>(Adam gets in Barry's car)
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Is that fuzz gel?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- A little. Special day, graduation.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Never thought I'd make it.
</p><p>(Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Three days grade school,
</p><p>three days high school...
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Those were awkward.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Three days college. I'm glad I took
</p><p>a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
</p><p>ADAM==
</p><p>You did come back different.
</p><p>(Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
</p><p>ARTIE:
</p><p>- Hi, Barry!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Hear about Frankie?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p>ADAM==
</p><p>- You going to the funeral?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No, I'm not going to his funeral.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Everybody knows,
</p><p>sting someone, you die.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Don't waste it on a squirrel.
</p><p>Such a hothead.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>I guess he could have
</p><p>just gotten out of the way.
</p><p>(The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
</p><p>highway)
</p><p> :
</p><p>I love this incorporating
</p><p>an amusement park into our regular day.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
</p><p>(Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
</p><p>students)
</p><p>Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
</p><p>under the circumstances.
</p><p>(Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Well, Adam, today we are men.
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- We are!
</p><p>BARRY=
</p><p>- Bee-men.
</p><p>=ADAM=
</p><p>- Amen!
</p><p>BARRY AND ADAM:
</p><p>Hallelujah!
</p><p>(Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm)
</p><p>ANNOUNCER:
</p><p>Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
</p><p> :
</p><p>please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
</p><p>DEAN BUZZWELL:
</p><p>Welcome, New Hive Oity
</p><p>graduating class of...
</p><p> :
</p><p>...9:
</p><p> :
</p><p>That concludes our ceremonies.
</p><p> :
</p><p>And begins your career
</p><p>at Honex Industries!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Will we pick our job today?
</p><p>(Adam and Barry get into a tour bus)
</p><p>BARRY=
</p><p>I heard it's just orientation.
</p><p>(Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically
</p><p>loaded into the buses)
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE:
</p><p>Heads up! Here we go.
</p><p>
</p><p>ANNOUNCER:
</p><p>Keep your hands and antennas
</p><p>inside the tram at all times.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Wonder what it'll be like?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- A little scary.
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE==
</p><p>Welcome to Honex,
</p><p>a division of Honesco
</p><p> :
</p><p>and a part of the Hexagon Group.
</p><p>Barry:
</p><p>This is it!
</p><p>BARRY AND ADAM:
</p><p>Wow.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Wow.
</p><p>(The bus drives down a road an on either side are the Bee's massive
</p><p>complicated Honey-making machines)
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE:
</p><p>We know that you, as a bee,
</p><p>have worked your whole life
</p><p> :
</p><p>to get to the point where you
</p><p>can work for your whole life.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
</p><p>Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Our top-secret formula
</p><p> :
</p><p>is automatically color-corrected,
</p><p>
</p><p>scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
</p><p> :
</p><p>into this soothing sweet syrup
</p><p> :
</p><p>with its distinctive
</p><p>golden glow you know as...
</p><p>EVERYONE ON BUS:
</p><p>Honey!
</p><p>(The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
</p><p>the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- That girl was hot.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- She's my cousin!
</p><p>ADAM==
</p><p>- She is?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yes, we're all cousins.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Right. You're right.
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE:
</p><p>- At Honex, we constantly strive
</p><p> :
</p><p>to improve every aspect
</p><p>of bee existence.
</p><p> :
</p><p>These bees are stress-testing
</p><p>a new helmet technology.
</p><p>(The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
</p><p>ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
</p><p>you can hear him groan)
</p><p> :
</p><p>ADAM==
</p><p>
</p><p>- What do you think he makes?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Not enough.
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE:
</p><p>Here we have our latest advancement,
</p><p>the Krelman.
</p><p>(They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each
</p><p>wearing a finger-shaped hat)
</p><p>Barry:
</p><p>- Wow, What does that do?
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE:
</p><p>- Catches that little strand of honey
</p><p> :
</p><p>that hangs after you pour it.
</p><p>Saves us millions.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>(Intrigued)
</p><p>Can anyone work on the Krelman?
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE:
</p><p>Of course. Most bee jobs are
</p><p>small ones.
</p><p>But bees know that every small job,
</p><p>if it's done well, means a lot.
</p><p> :
</p><p>But choose carefully
</p><p> :
</p><p>because you'll stay in the job
</p><p>you pick for the rest of your life.
</p><p>(Everyone claps except for Barry)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>The same job the rest of your life?
</p><p>I didn't know that.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>
</p><p>What's the difference?
</p><p>TOUR GUIDE:
</p><p>You'll be happy to know that bees,
</p><p>as a species, haven't had one day off
</p><p> :
</p><p>in 27 million years.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Upset)
</p><p>So you'll just work us to death?
</p><p> :
</p><p>We'll sure try.
</p><p>(Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
</p><p>home together)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Wow! That blew my mind!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>"What's the difference?"
</p><p>How can you say that?
</p><p> :
</p><p>One job forever?
</p><p>That's an insane choice to have to make.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>I'm relieved. Now we only have
</p><p>to make one decision in life.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>But, Adam, how could they
</p><p>never have told us that?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Why would you question anything?
</p><p>We're bees.
</p><p> :
</p><p>We're the most perfectly
</p><p>functioning society on Earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You ever think maybe things
</p><p>work a little too well here?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Like what? Give me one example.
</p><p>(Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that
</p><p>hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect
</p><p>unison)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I don't know. But you know
</p><p>what I'm talking about.
</p><p>ANNOUNCER:
</p><p>Please clear the gate.
</p><p>Royal Nectar Force on approach.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Wait a second. Check it out.
</p><p>(The Pollen jocks fly in, circle around and landing in line)
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Wow.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I've never seen them this close.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>They know what it's like
</p><p>outside the hive.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Yeah, but some don't come back.
</p><p>GIRL BEES:
</p><p>- Hey, Jocks!
</p><p>- Hi, Jocks!
</p><p>(The Pollen Jocks hook up their backpacks to machines that pump the nectar
</p><p>to trucks, which drive away)
</p><p>
</p><p>LOU LO DUVA:
</p><p>You guys did great!
</p><p> :
</p><p>You're monsters!
</p><p>You're sky freaks!
</p><p>I love it!
</p><p>(Punching the Pollen Jocks in joy)
</p><p>I love it!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- I wonder where they were.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I don't know.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Their day's not planned.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Outside the hive, flying who knows
</p><p>where, doing who knows what.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You can't just decide to be a Pollen
</p><p>Jock. You have to be bred for that.
</p><p>ADAM==
</p><p>Right.
</p><p>(Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen
</p><p>Jocks)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Look at that. That's more pollen
</p><p>than you and I will see in a lifetime.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>It's just a status symbol.
</p><p>Bees make too much of it.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
</p><p>and the ladies see you wearing it.
</p><p>(Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM==
</p><p>Those ladies?
</p><p>Aren't they our cousins too?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Distant. Distant.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>Look at these two.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>- Couple of Hive Harrys.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>- Let's have fun with them.
</p><p>GIRL BEE #1:
</p><p>It must be dangerous
</p><p>being a Pollen Jock.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
</p><p>against a mushroom!
</p><p> :
</p><p>He had a paw on my throat,
</p><p>and with the other, he was slapping me!
</p><p>(Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
</p><p>GIRL BEE #2:
</p><p>- Oh, my!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I never thought I'd knock him out.
</p><p>GIRL BEE #1:
</p><p>(Looking at Adam)
</p><p>What were you doing during this?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I can autograph that.
</p><p>
</p><p>(The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and
</p><p>Adam really are pollen jocks.)
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>A little gusty out there today,
</p><p>wasn't it, comrades?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yeah. Gusty.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>We're hitting a sunflower patch
</p><p>six miles from here tomorrow.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Six miles, huh?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Barry!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>A puddle jump for us,
</p><p>but maybe you're not up for it.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Maybe I am.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- You are not!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
</p><p> :
</p><p>What do you think, buzzy-boy?
</p><p>Are you bee enough?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I might be. It all depends
</p><p>on what 0900 means.
</p><p>(The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at
</p><p>night)
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>
</p><p>Hey, Honex!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Dad, you surprised me.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>You decide what you're interested in?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Well, there's a lot of choices.
</p><p>- But you only get one.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Do you ever get bored
</p><p>doing the same job every day?
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You grab that stick, and you just
</p><p>move it around, and you stir it around.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You get yourself into a rhythm.
</p><p>It's a beautiful thing.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You know, Dad,
</p><p>the more I think about it,
</p><p> :
</p><p>maybe the honey field
</p><p>just isn't right for me.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>You were thinking of what,
</p><p>making balloon animals?
</p><p> :
</p><p>That's a bad job
</p><p>for a guy with a stinger.
</p><p> :
</p><p>
</p><p>Janet, your son's not sure
</p><p>he wants to go into honey!
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I'm not trying to be funny.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>You're not funny! You're going
</p><p>into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- You're gonna be a stirrer?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No one's listening to me!
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>Wait till you see the sticks I have.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I could say anything right now.
</p><p>I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
</p><p>(Barry's parents don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>Let's open some honey and celebrate!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
</p><p>Shave my antennae.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
</p><p>a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>I'm so proud.
</p><p>(The scene cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- We're starting work today!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Today's the day.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Come on! All the good jobs
</p><p>will be gone.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yeah, right.
</p><p>JOB LISTER:
</p><p>Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
</p><p>stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
</p><p>BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:
</p><p>- Is it still available?
</p><p>JOB LISTER:
</p><p>- Hang on. Two left!
</p><p> :
</p><p>One of them's yours! Congratulations!
</p><p>Step to the side.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- What'd you get?
</p><p>BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:
</p><p>- Picking crud out. Stellar!
</p><p>(He walks away)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Wow!
</p><p>JOB LISTER:
</p><p>Couple of newbies?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
</p><p>JOB LISTER:
</p><p>Make your choice.
</p><p>(Adam and Barry look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly
</p><p>changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very
</p><p>confusing)
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- You want to go first?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No, you go.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Oh, my. What's available?
</p><p>JOB LISTER:
</p><p>Restroom attendant's open,
</p><p>not for the reason you think.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
</p><p>JOB LISTER:
</p><p>- Sure, you're on.
</p><p>(Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head)
</p><p>(Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
</p><p>(Takes Adam's hat off)
</p><p>Wax monkey's always open.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>The Krelman opened up again.
</p><p> :
</p><p>What happened?
</p><p>JOB LISTER:
</p><p>A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
</p><p>He's dead. Another dead one.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Dead from the neck up.
</p><p>Dead from the neck down. That's life!
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Oh, this is so hard!
</p><p>(Barry remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off)
</p><p>Heating, cooling,
</p><p>stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
</p><p> :
</p><p>humming, inspector number seven,
</p><p>lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
</p><p> :
</p><p>mite wrangler. Barry, what
</p><p>do you think I should... Barry?
</p><p>(Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Barry!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK:
</p><p>All right, we've got the sunflower patch
</p><p>in quadrant nine...
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>(Through phone)
</p><p>What happened to you?
</p><p>Where are you?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I'm going out.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Out? Out where?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Out there.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Oh, no!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I have to, before I go
</p><p>to work for the rest of my life.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>
</p><p>You're gonna die! You're crazy!
</p><p>(Barry hangs up)
</p><p>Hello?
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>Another call coming in.
</p><p> :
</p><p>If anyone's feeling brave,
</p><p>there's a Korean deli on 83rd
</p><p> :
</p><p>that gets their roses today.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Hey, guys.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1 ==
</p><p>- Look at that.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
</p><p>LOU LO DUVA:
</p><p>Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
</p><p>(Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)
</p><p>LOU LO DUVA:
</p><p>(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
</p><p>BEE WITH CLIPBOARD:
</p><p>(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Thank you.
</p><p>LOU LO DUVA:
</p><p>- OK.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You got a rain advisory today,
</p><p> :
</p><p>
</p><p>and as you all know,
</p><p>bees cannot fly in rain.
</p><p> :
</p><p>So be careful. As always,
</p><p>watch your brooms,
</p><p> :
</p><p>hockey sticks, dogs,
</p><p>birds, bears and bats.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Also, I got a couple of reports
</p><p>of root beer being poured on us.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Murphy's in a home because of it,
</p><p>babbling like a cicada!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- That's awful.
</p><p>LOU LO DUVA:
</p><p>(Still talking through megaphone)
</p><p>- And a reminder for you rookies,
</p><p> :
</p><p>bee law number one,
</p><p>absolutely no talking to humans!
</p><p> :
</p><p>All right, launch positions!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCKS:
</p><p>(The Pollen Jocks run into formation)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
</p><p>buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
</p><p>LOU LU DUVA:
</p><p>Black and yellow!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCKS:
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>(To Barry)You ready for this, hot shot?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK's:
</p><p>Wind, check.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Antennae, check.
</p><p>- Nectar pack, check.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Wings, check.
</p><p>- Stinger, check.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Scared out of my shorts, check.
</p><p>LOU LO DUVA:
</p><p>OK, ladies,
</p><p> :
</p><p>let's move it out!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Pound those petunias,
</p><p>you striped stem-suckers!
</p><p> :
</p><p>All of you, drain those flowers!
</p><p>(The pollen jocks fly out of the hive)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Wow! I'm out!
</p><p> :
</p><p>I can't believe I'm out!
</p><p> :
</p><p>So blue.
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>I feel so fast and free!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Box kite!
</p><p>(Barry flies through the kite)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Wow!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Flowers!
</p><p>(A pollen jock puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to
</p><p>heat sink goggles.)
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK:
</p><p>This is Blue Leader.
</p><p>We have roses visual.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Roses!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Stand to the side, kid.
</p><p>It's got a bit of a kick.
</p><p>(The pollen jock fires a high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that
</p><p>suck up the nectar from the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>That is one nectar collector!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1==
</p><p>- Ever see pollination up close?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No, sir.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>
</p><p>(Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles
</p><p>pollen as he goes)
</p><p> :
</p><p>I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
</p><p>over here. Maybe a dash over there,
</p><p> :
</p><p>a pinch on that one.
</p><p>See that? It's a little bit of magic.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>That's amazing. Why do we do that?
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>That's pollen power. More pollen, more
</p><p>flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Cool.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
</p><p>could be daisies. Don't we need those?
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>Copy that visual.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Wait. One of these flowers
</p><p>seems to be on the move.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>Say again? You're reporting
</p><p>a moving flower?
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>Affirmative.
</p><p>(The Pollen jocks land near the "flowers" which, to the audience are
</p><p>obviously just tennis balls)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(In the distance) That was on the line!
</p><p>
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>This is the coolest. What is it?
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
</p><p> :
</p><p>It smells good.
</p><p>Not like a flower, but I like it.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>Yeah, fuzzy.
</p><p>(Sticks his hand on the ball but it gets stuck)
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #3==
</p><p>Chemical-y.
</p><p>(The pollen jock finally gets his hand free from the tennis ball)
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
</p><p>(The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on top of
</p><p>one of the tennis balls)
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>My sweet lord of bees!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #3:
</p><p>Candy-brain, get off there!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>(Pointing upwards)
</p><p>Problem!
</p><p>(A human hand reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck
</p><p>to)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Guys!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>- This could be bad.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #3:
</p><p>Affirmative.
</p><p>(Vanessa Bloome starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick
</p><p>to it)
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY==
</p><p>Very close.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Gonna hurt.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Mama's little boy.
</p><p>(Barry is being hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is
</p><p>still stuck to the ball)
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>You are way out of position, rookie!
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Coming in at you like a MISSILE!
</p><p>(Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(In slow motion)
</p><p>Help me!
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #2:
</p><p>I don't think these are flowers.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #3:
</p><p>- Should we tell him?
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>- I think he knows.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What is this?!
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Match point!
</p><p> :
</p><p>You can start packing up, honey,
</p><p>because you're about to EAT IT!
</p><p>(A pollen jock coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way
</p><p>with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>Yowser!
</p><p>(Barry bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies
</p><p>into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Ew, gross.
</p><p>(The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows Barry
</p><p>into the car)
</p><p>GIRL IN CAR:
</p><p>There's a bee in the car!
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Do something!
</p><p>DAD DRIVING CAR:
</p><p>- I'm driving!
</p><p>BABY GIRL:
</p><p>(Waving at Barry)
</p><p>- Hi, bee.
</p><p>(Barry smiles and waves at the baby girl)
</p><p>GUY IN BACK OF CAR:
</p><p>- He's back here!
</p><p> :
</p><p>He's going to sting me!
</p><p>GIRL IN CAR:
</p><p>Nobody move. If you don't move,
</p><p>he won't sting you. Freeze!
</p><p>(Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car)
</p><p> :
</p><p>GRANDMA IN CAR==
</p><p>He blinked!
</p><p>(The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays everywhere in the car,
</p><p>climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)
</p><p>GIRL IN CAR:
</p><p>Spray him, Granny!
</p><p>DAD DRIVING THE CAR:
</p><p>What are you doing?!
</p><p>(Barry escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above
</p><p>
</p><p>the ground, safe.)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Wow... the tension level
</p><p>out here is unbelievable.
</p><p>(Barry sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds
</p><p>moving into this direction)
</p><p> :
</p><p>I gotta get home.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Can't fly in rain.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Can't fly in rain.
</p><p>(A rain drop hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Can't fly in rain.
</p><p>(A second rain drop hits Barry again and he spirals downwards)
</p><p>Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
</p><p>(WW2 plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a
</p><p>plant inside an apartment near the window)
</p><p>VANESSA BLOOME:
</p><p>Ken, could you close
</p><p>the window please?
</p><p>KEN==
</p><p>Hey, check out my new resume.
</p><p>I made it into a fold-out brochure.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You see?
</p><p>(Folds brochure resume out)
</p><p>Folds out.
</p><p>(Ken closes the window, trapping Barry inside)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
</p><p>(Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)
</p><p> :
</p><p>What was that?
</p><p>
</p><p>(Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back
</p><p>because the window is closed)
</p><p>Maybe this time. This time. This time.
</p><p>This time! This time! This...
</p><p> :
</p><p>Drapes!
</p><p>(Barry taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)
</p><p>That is diabolical.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>It's fantastic. It's got all my special
</p><p>skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
</p><p>ANDY:
</p><p>What's number one? Star Wars?
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Nah, I don't go for that...
</p><p>(Ken makes finger guns and makes "pew pew pew" sounds and then stops)
</p><p> :
</p><p>...kind of stuff.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
</p><p>They're out of their minds.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>When I leave a job interview, they're
</p><p>flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Looking at the light on the ceiling)
</p><p>There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
</p><p>(Starts flying towards the lightbulb)
</p><p> :
</p><p>I don't remember the sun
</p><p>having a big 75 on it.
</p><p>(Barry hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the
</p><p>humans are sitting at)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>
</p><p>I predicted global warming.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I could feel it getting hotter.
</p><p>At first I thought it was just me.
</p><p>(Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and
</p><p>is about to put it in his mouth)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Wait! Stop! Bee!
</p><p>(Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans
</p><p>freak out)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Stand back. These are winter boots.
</p><p>(Ken has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but
</p><p>Vanessa saves him last second)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Wait!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Don't kill him!
</p><p>(Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>You know I'm allergic to them!
</p><p>This thing could kill me!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Why does his life have
</p><p>less value than yours?
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Why does his life have any less value
</p><p>than mine? Is that your statement?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I'm just saying all life has value. You
</p><p>don't know what he's capable of feeling.
</p><p>(Vanessa picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can
</p><p>carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>
</p><p>My brochure!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>There you go, little guy.
</p><p>(Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is
</p><p>still shocked that a human saved his life)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>I'm not scared of him.
</p><p>It's an allergic thing.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Put that on your resume brochure.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>My whole face could puff up.
</p><p>ANDY:
</p><p>Make it one of your special skills.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Knocking someone out
</p><p>is also a special skill.
</p><p>(Ken walks to the door)
</p><p>Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
</p><p> :
</p><p>(Vanessa tries to close door)
</p><p>KEN==
</p><p>- You could put carob chips on there.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Bye.
</p><p>(Closes door but Ken opens it again)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>- Supposed to be less calories.
</p><p>
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Bye.
</p><p>(Closes door)
</p><p>(Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside the house. He flies
</p><p>into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes)
</p><p>BARRY==
</p><p>(Talking to himself)
</p><p>I gotta say something.
</p><p> :
</p><p>She saved my life.
</p><p>I gotta say something.
</p><p> :
</p><p>All right, here it goes.
</p><p>(Turns back)
</p><p>Nah.
</p><p> :
</p><p>What would I say?
</p><p> :
</p><p>I could really get in trouble.
</p><p> :
</p><p>It's a bee law.
</p><p>You're not supposed to talk to a human.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I can't believe I'm doing this.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I've got to.
</p><p>(Barry disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by
</p><p>again)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
</p><p> :
</p><p>No. Yes. No.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Do it. I can't.
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>How should I start it?
</p><p>(Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows)
</p><p>"You like jazz?"
</p><p>No, that's no good.
</p><p>(Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)
</p><p>Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
</p><p> :
</p><p>...Hi!
</p><p>(Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the
</p><p>counter)
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm sorry.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- You're talking.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yes, I know.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(Pointing at Barry)
</p><p>You're talking!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I'm so sorry.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>No, it's OK. It's fine.
</p><p>I know I'm dreaming.
</p><p> :
</p><p>But I don't recall going to bed.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Well, I'm sure this
</p><p>is very disconcerting.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>This is a bit of a surprise to me.
</p><p>I mean, you're a bee!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I am. And I'm not supposed
</p><p>to be doing this,
</p><p>(Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)
</p><p>but they were all trying to kill me.
</p><p> :
</p><p>And if it wasn't for you...
</p><p> :
</p><p>I had to thank you.
</p><p>It's just how I was raised.
</p><p>(Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)
</p><p> :
</p><p>That was a little weird.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- I'm talking with a bee.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I'm talking to a bee.
</p><p>And the bee is talking to me!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I just want to say I'm grateful.
</p><p>I'll leave now.
</p><p>(Barry turns to leave)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Flying back)
</p><p>- What?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>The talking...thing.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>Same way you did, I guess.
</p><p>"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- That's very funny.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
</p><p>we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Anyway...
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Can I...
</p><p> :
</p><p>...get you something?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Like what?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I don't know. I mean...
</p><p>I don't know. Coffee?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I don't want to put you out.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- It's just coffee.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I hate to impose.
</p><p>(Vanessa starts making coffee)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Don't be ridiculous!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Actually, I would love a cup.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Hey, you want rum cake?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I shouldn't.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Have some.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No, I can't.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Come on!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Where?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- These stripes don't help.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You look great!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I don't know if you know
</p><p>anything about fashion.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Are you all right?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely)
</p><p>No.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table
</p><p>on top of the apartment building drinking coffee)
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>BARRY==
</p><p>He's making the tie in the cab
</p><p>as they're flying up Madison.
</p><p> :
</p><p>He finally gets there.
</p><p> :
</p><p>He runs up the steps into the church.
</p><p>The wedding is on.
</p><p> :
</p><p>And he says, "Watermelon?
</p><p>I thought you said Guatemalan.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Why would I marry a watermelon?"
</p><p>(Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Is that a bee joke?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>That's the kind of stuff we do.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Yeah, different.
</p><p> :
</p><p>So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
</p><p>(Barry stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it
</p><p>around with a straw like it's a gondola)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>About work? I don't know.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I want to do my part for the hive,
</p><p>but I can't do it the way they want.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I know how you feel.
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- You do?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Sure.
</p><p> :
</p><p>My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
</p><p>a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Really?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- My only interest is flowers.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Our new queen was just elected
</p><p>with that same campaign slogan.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Anyway, if you look...
</p><p>(Barry points to a tree in the middle of Central Park)
</p><p> :
</p><p>There's my hive right there. See it?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You're in Sheep Meadow!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>No way! I know that area.
</p><p>I lost a toe ring there once.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Why not?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Maybe I'll try that.
</p><p>(A custodian installing a lightbulb looks over at them but to his
</p><p>perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup of coffee on the
</p><p>table)
</p><p>CUSTODIAN:
</p><p>- You all right, ma'am?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Oh, yeah. Fine.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Just having two cups of coffee!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Anyway, this has been great.
</p><p>Thanks for the coffee.
</p><p>VANESSA==
</p><p>Yeah, it's no trouble.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
</p><p>I'd be up the rest of my life.
</p><p>(Barry points towards the rum cake)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Can I take a piece of this with me?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Sure! Here, have a crumb.
</p><p>(Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Thanks!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>All right. Well, then...
</p><p>I guess I'll see you around.
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>Or not.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>OK, Barry...
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>And thank you
</p><p>so much again... for before.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Oh, that? That was nothing.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
</p><p>(Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because
</p><p>her hands is to big and Barry holds that)
</p><p>(The custodian looks over again and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her
</p><p>coffee again. The lightbulb that he was screwing in sparks and he falls off
</p><p>the ladder)
</p><p>(Fast forward in time and we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute
</p><p>in a Honex wind tunnel)
</p><p>BEE SCIENTIST #1:
</p><p>This can't possibly work.
</p><p>BEE SCIENTIST #2:
</p><p>He's all set to go.
</p><p>We may as well try it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>OK, Dave, pull the chute.
</p><p>(Dave pulls the chute and the wind slams him against the wall and he falls
</p><p>on his face.The camera pans over and we see Barry and Adam walking
</p><p>together)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Sounds amazing.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- It was amazing!
</p><p> :
</p><p>It was the scariest,
</p><p>happiest moment of my life.
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Humans! I can't believe
</p><p>you were with humans!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Giant, scary humans!
</p><p>What were they like?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
</p><p> :
</p><p>They eat crazy giant things.
</p><p>They drive crazy.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Some of them. But some of them don't.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- How'd you get back?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Poodle.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
</p><p>whatever you wanted to see.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You had your "experience." Now you
</p><p>can pick out your job and be normal.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Well...
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Well?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Well, I met someone.
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>You did? Was she Bee-ish?
</p><p> :
</p><p>- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No, no, no, not a wasp.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Spider?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I'm not attracted to spiders.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I know, for everyone else, it's the hottest thing,
</p><p>with the eight legs and all.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I can't get by that face.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>So who is she?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>She's... human.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>No, no. That's a bee law.
</p><p>You wouldn't break a bee law.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Her name's Vanessa.
</p><p>(Adam puts his head in his hands)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Oh, boy.
</p><p>BARRY==
</p><p>She's so nice. And she's a florist!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>We're not dating.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>You're flying outside the hive, talking
</p><p>to humans that attack our homes
</p><p> :
</p><p>with power washers and M-80s!
</p><p>That's one-eighth a stick of dynamite!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>She saved my life!
</p><p>And she understands me.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>This is over!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Eat this.
</p><p>(Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats
</p><p>it)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>(Adam's tone changes)
</p><p>This is not over! What was that?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- They call it a crumb.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- It was so stingin' stripey!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>And that's not what they eat.
</p><p>That's what falls off what they eat!
</p><p> :
</p><p>- You know what a Cinnabon is?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- No.
</p><p>(Adam opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Be quiet!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>They heat it up...
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Sit down!
</p><p>(Adam forces Barry to sit down)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Still rambling about Cinnabons)
</p><p>...really hot!
</p><p>(Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Listen to me!
</p><p> :
</p><p>We are not them! We're us.
</p><p>There's us and there's them!
</p><p>BARRY==
</p><p>Yes, but who can deny
</p><p>the heart that is yearning?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>There's no yearning.
</p><p>Stop yearning. Listen to me!
</p><p> :
</p><p>You have got to start thinking bee,
</p><p>my friend. Thinking bee!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Thinking bee.
</p><p>WORKER BEE:
</p><p>- Thinking bee.
</p><p>WORKER BEES AND ADAM:
</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
</p><p>
</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
</p><p>(Flash forward in time; Barry is laying on a raft in a pool full of honey.
</p><p>He is wearing sunglasses)
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>There he is. He's in the pool.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>You know what your problem is, Barry?
</p><p>(Barry pulls down his sunglasses and he looks annoyed)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Sarcastic)
</p><p>I gotta start thinking bee?
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>How much longer will this go on?
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>It's been three days!
</p><p>Why aren't you working?
</p><p>(Puts sunglasses back on)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I've got a lot of big life decisions
</p><p>to think about.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>What life? You have no life!
</p><p>You have no job. You're barely a bee!
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>Would it kill you
</p><p>to make a little honey?
</p><p>(Barry rolls off the raft and sinks into the honey pool)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Barry, come out.
</p><p>Your father's talking to you.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Martin, would you talk to him?
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>
</p><p>Barry, I'm talking to you!
</p><p>(Barry keeps sinking into the honey until he is suddenly in Central Park
</p><p>having a picnic with Vanessa)
</p><p>(Barry has a cup of honey and he clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly a
</p><p>mosquito lands on Vanessa and she slaps it, killing it. They both gasp but
</p><p>then burst out laughing)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You coming?
</p><p>(The camera pans over and Vanessa is climbing into a small yellow airplane)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Got everything?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>All set!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Go ahead. I'll catch up.
</p><p>(Vanessa lifts off and flies ahead)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Don't be too long.
</p><p>(Barry catches up with Vanessa and he sticks out his arms like ana irplane.
</p><p>He rolls from side to side, and Vanessa copies him with the airplane)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Watch this!
</p><p>(Barry stays back and watches as Vanessa draws a heart in the air using
</p><p>pink smoke from the plane, but on the last loop-the-loop she suddenly
</p><p>crashes into a mountain and the plane explodes. The destroyed plane falls
</p><p>into some rocks and explodes a second time)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Vanessa!
</p><p>(As Barry is yelling his mouth fills with honey and he wakes up,
</p><p>discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back into the
</p><p>honey pool)
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>- We're still here.
</p><p>
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- I told you not to yell at him.
</p><p> :
</p><p>He doesn't respond to yelling!
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>- Then why yell at me?
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- Because you don't listen!
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>I'm not listening to this.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Sorry, I've gotta go.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>- Where are you going?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I'm meeting a friend.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Bye.
</p><p>(Barry flies out the door and Martin shakes his head)
</p><p> :
</p><p>JANET==
</p><p>I just hope she's Bee-ish.
</p><p>(Fast forward in time and Barry is sitting on Vanessa's shoulder and she is
</p><p>closing up her shop)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>They have a huge parade
</p><p>of flowers every year in Pasadena?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>To be in the Tournament of Roses,
</p><p>that's every florist's dream!
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>Up on a float, surrounded
</p><p>by flowers, crowds cheering.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>A tournament. Do the roses
</p><p>compete in athletic events?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>No. All right, I've got one.
</p><p>How come you don't fly everywhere?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It's exhausting. Why don't you
</p><p>run everywhere? It's faster.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
</p><p>All right, your turn.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
</p><p>That's insane!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You don't have that?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
</p><p>It's a horrible, horrible disease.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Oh, my.
</p><p>(A human walks by and Barry narrowly avoids him)
</p><p>PASSERBY:
</p><p>Dumb bees!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You must want to sting all those jerks.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>We try not to sting.
</p><p>
</p><p>It's usually fatal for us.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>So you have to watch your temper
</p><p>(They walk into a store)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Very carefully.
</p><p>You kick a wall, take a walk,
</p><p> :
</p><p>write an angry letter and throw it out.
</p><p>Work through it like any emotion:
</p><p> :
</p><p>Anger, jealousy, lust.
</p><p>(Suddenly an employee(Hector) hits Barry off of Vanessa's shoulder. Hector
</p><p>thinks he's saving Vanessa)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(To Barry)
</p><p>Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
</p><p>(Barry is getting up off the floor)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yeah.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(To Hector)
</p><p>- What is wrong with you?!
</p><p>HECTOR:
</p><p>(Confused)
</p><p>- It's a bug.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>He's not bothering anybody.
</p><p>Get out of here, you creep!
</p><p>(Vanessa hits Hector across the face with the magazine he had and then hits
</p><p>him in the head. Hector backs away covering his head)
</p><p>Barry:
</p><p>What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
</p><p>(Vanessa sets Barry back on her shoulder)
</p><p>
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Yeah, it was. How did you know?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It felt like about 10 pages.
</p><p>Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You've really got that
</p><p>down to a science.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Oh, we have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- I'll bet.
</p><p>(Barry looks to his right and notices there is honey for sale in the aisle)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What in the name
</p><p>of Mighty Hercules is this?
</p><p>(Barry looks at all the brands of honey, shocked)
</p><p>How did this get here?
</p><p>Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,
</p><p> :
</p><p>Ray Liotta Private Select?
</p><p>(Barry puts his hands up and slowly turns around, a look of disgust on his
</p><p>face)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Is he that actor?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I never heard of him.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Why is this here?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- For people. We eat it.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>You don't have
</p><p>enough food of your own?!
</p><p>(Hector looks back and notices that Vanessa is talking to Barry)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Well, yes.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- How do you get it?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Bees make it.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I know who makes it!
</p><p> :
</p><p>And it's hard to make it!
</p><p> :
</p><p>There's heating, cooling, stirring.
</p><p>You need a whole Krelman thing!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- It's organic.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- It's our-ganic!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>It's just honey, Barry.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Just what?!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Bees don't know about this!
</p><p>This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
</p><p> :
</p><p>You've taken our homes, schools,
</p><p>hospitals! This is all we have!
</p><p> :
</p><p>
</p><p>And it's on sale?!
</p><p>I'm getting to the bottom of this.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm getting to the bottom
</p><p>of all of this!
</p><p>(Flash forward in time; Barry paints his face with black strikes like a
</p><p>soldier and sneaks into the storage section of the store)
</p><p>(Two men, including Hector, are loading boxes into some trucks)
</p><p> :
</p><p>SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE==
</p><p>Hey, Hector.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- You almost done?
</p><p>HECTOR:
</p><p>- Almost.
</p><p>(Barry takes a step to peak around the corner)
</p><p>(Whispering)
</p><p>He is here. I sense it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Well, I guess I'll go home now
</p><p>(Hector pretends to walk away by walking in place and speaking loudly)
</p><p> :
</p><p>and just leave this nice honey out,
</p><p>with no one around.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You're busted, box boy!
</p><p>HECTOR:
</p><p>I knew I heard something!
</p><p>So you can talk!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I can talk.
</p><p>And now you'll start talking!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Where you getting the sweet stuff?
</p><p>
</p><p>Who's your supplier?
</p><p>HECTOR:
</p><p>I don't understand.
</p><p>I thought we were friends.
</p><p> :
</p><p>The last thing we want
</p><p>to do is upset bees!
</p><p>(Hector takes a thumbtack out of the board behind him and sword-fights
</p><p>Barry. Barry is using his stinger like a sword)
</p><p> :
</p><p>You're too late! It's ours now!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You, sir, have crossed
</p><p>the wrong sword!
</p><p>HECTOR:
</p><p>You, sir, will be lunch
</p><p>for my iguana, Ignacio!
</p><p>(Barry hits the thumbtack out of Hectors hand and Hector surrenders)
</p><p>Barry:
</p><p>Where is the honey coming from?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Tell me where!
</p><p>HECTOR:
</p><p>(Pointing to leaving truck)
</p><p>Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
</p><p>(Barry chases after the truck but it is getting away. He flies onto a
</p><p>bicyclists' backpack and he catches up to the truck)
</p><p>CAR DRIVER:
</p><p>(To bicyclist)
</p><p>Crazy person!
</p><p>(Barry flies off and lands on the windshield of the Honey farms truck.
</p><p>Barry looks around and sees dead bugs splattered everywhere)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What horrible thing has happened here?
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>These faces, they never knew
</p><p>what hit them. And now
</p><p> :
</p><p>they're on the road to nowhere!
</p><p>(Barry hears a sudden whisper)
</p><p>(Barry looks up and sees Mooseblood, a mosquito playing dead)
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Just keep still.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What? You're not dead?
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
</p><p>that moves. Where you headed?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>To Honey Farms.
</p><p>I am onto something huge here.
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
</p><p>crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
</p><p>ANOTHER BUG PLAYING DEAD:
</p><p>I'm going to Tacoma.
</p><p>(Barry looks at another bug)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- And you?
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>- He really is dead.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>All right.
</p><p>(Another bug hits the windshield and the drivers notice. They activate the
</p><p>windshield wipers)
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD==
</p><p>Uh-oh!
</p><p>(The windshield wipers are slowly sliding over the dead bugs and wiping
</p><p>
</p><p>them off)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- What is that?!
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>- Oh, no!
</p><p> :
</p><p>- A wiper! Triple blade!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Triple blade?
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
</p><p>(Mooseblood and Barry grab onto the wiper and they hold on as it wipes the
</p><p>windshield)
</p><p>Why does everything have
</p><p>to be so doggone clean?!
</p><p> :
</p><p>How much do you people need to see?!
</p><p>(Bangs on windshield)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Open your eyes!
</p><p>Stick your head out the window!
</p><p>RADIO IN TRUCK:
</p><p>From NPR News in Washington,
</p><p>I'm Carl Kasell.
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>But don't kill no more bugs!
</p><p>(Mooseblood and Barry are washed off by the wipr fluid)
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>- Bee!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Moose blood guy!!
</p><p>(Barry starts screaming as he hangs onto the antenna)
</p><p>(Suddenly it is revealed that a water bug is also hanging on the antenna.
</p><p>
</p><p>There is a pause and then Barry and the water bug both start screaming)
</p><p>TRUCK DRIVER:
</p><p>- You hear something?
</p><p>GUY IN TRUCK:
</p><p>- Like what?
</p><p>TRUCK DRIVER:
</p><p>Like tiny screaming.
</p><p>GUY IN TRUCK:
</p><p>Turn off the radio.
</p><p>(The antenna starts to lower until it gets to low and sinks into the truck.
</p><p>The water bug flies off and Barry is forced to let go and he is blown away.
</p><p>He luckily lands inside a horn on top of the truck where he finds
</p><p>Mooseblood, who was blown into the same place)
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Whassup, bee boy?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Hey, Blood.
</p><p>(Fast forward in time and we see that Barry is deep in conversation with
</p><p>Mooseblood. They have been sitting in this truck for a while)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>...Just a row of honey jars,
</p><p>as far as the eye could see.
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Wow!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I assume wherever this truck goes
</p><p>is where they're getting it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I mean, that honey's ours.
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>- Bees hang tight.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>- We're all jammed in.
</p><p> :
</p><p>It's a close community.
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Not us, man. We on our own.
</p><p>Every mosquito on his own.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- What if you get in trouble?
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>- You a mosquito, you in trouble.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Nobody likes us. They just smack.
</p><p>See a mosquito, smack, smack!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>At least you're out in the world.
</p><p>You must meet girls.
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Mosquito girls try to trade up,
</p><p>get with a moth, dragonfly.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
</p><p>(An ambulance passes by and it has a blood donation sign on it)
</p><p>You got to be kidding me!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Mooseblood's about to leave
</p><p>the building! So long, bee!
</p><p>(Mooseblood leaves and flies onto the window of the ambulance where there
</p><p>are other mosquito's hanging out)
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Hey, guys!
</p><p>OTHER MOSQUITO:
</p><p>- Mooseblood!
</p><p>
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
</p><p>Did you bring your crazy straw?
</p><p>(The truck goes out of view and Barry notices that the truck he's on is
</p><p>pulling into a camp of some sort)
</p><p>TRUCK DRIVER:
</p><p>We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
</p><p>and it's pretty much pure profit.
</p><p>(Barry flies out)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What is this place?
</p><p>BEEKEEPER 1#:
</p><p>A bee's got a brain
</p><p>the size of a pinhead.
</p><p>BEEKEEPER #2:
</p><p>They are pinheads!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Pinhead.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Check out the new smoker.
</p><p>BEEKEEPER #1:
</p><p>- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
</p><p> :
</p><p>The Thomas 3000!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Smoker?
</p><p>BEEKEEPER #1:
</p><p>Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
</p><p>Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
</p><p> :
</p><p>A couple breaths of this
</p><p>knocks them right out.
</p><p>
</p><p>BEEKEEPER #2:
</p><p>They make the honey,
</p><p>and we make the money.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>"They make the honey,
</p><p>and we make the money"?
</p><p>(The Beekeeper sprays hundreds of cheap miniature apartments with the
</p><p>smoker. The bees are fainting or passing out)
</p><p>Oh, my!
</p><p> :
</p><p>What's going on? Are you OK?
</p><p>(Barry flies into one of the apartment and helps a Bee couple get off the
</p><p>ground. They are coughing and its hard for them to stand)
</p><p>BEE IN APARTMENT:
</p><p>Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Do you know you're
</p><p>in a fake hive with fake walls?
</p><p>BEE IN APPARTMENT:
</p><p>Our queen was moved here.
</p><p>We had no choice.
</p><p>(The apartment room is completely empty except for a photo on the wall of
</p><p>the "queen" who is obviously a man in women's clothes)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>This is your queen?
</p><p>That's a man in women's clothes!
</p><p> :
</p><p>That's a drag queen!
</p><p> :
</p><p>What is this?
</p><p>(Barry flies out and he discovers that there are hundreds of these
</p><p>structures, each housing thousands of Bees)
</p><p>Oh, no!
</p><p> :
</p><p>There's hundreds of them!
</p><p>(Barry takes out his camera and takes pictures of these Bee work camps. The
</p><p>beekeepers look very evil in these depictions)
</p><p>
</p><p>Bee honey.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Our honey is being brazenly stolen
</p><p>on a massive scale!
</p><p> :
</p><p>This is worse than anything bears
</p><p>have done! I intend to do something.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Barry is showing these pictures to his parents)
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>Oh, Barry, stop.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>Who told you humans are taking
</p><p>our honey? That's a rumor.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Do these look like rumors?
</p><p>(Holds up the pictures)
</p><p>UNCLE CARL:
</p><p>That's a conspiracy theory.
</p><p>These are obviously doctored photos.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>How did you get mixed up in this?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>He's been talking to humans.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- What?
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>- Talking to humans?!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>He has a human girlfriend.
</p><p>And they make out!
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>Make out? Barry!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>We do not.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- You wish you could.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>- Whose side are you on?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>The bees!
</p><p>UNCLE CARL:
</p><p>(He has been sitting in the back of the room this entire time)
</p><p>I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
</p><p>Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>Barry, this is what you want
</p><p>to do with your life?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I want to do it for all our lives.
</p><p>Nobody works harder than bees!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Dad, I remember you
</p><p>coming home so overworked
</p><p> :
</p><p>your hands were still stirring.
</p><p>You couldn't stop.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>I remember that.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What right do they have to our honey?
</p><p> :
</p><p>We live on two cups a year. They put it
</p><p>in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Sting them where it really hurts.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>In the face! The eye!
</p><p> :
</p><p>- That would hurt.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No.
</p><p>MARTIN:
</p><p>Up the nose? That's a killer.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>There's only one place you can sting
</p><p>the humans, one place where it matters.
</p><p>(Flash forward a bit in time and we are watching the Bee News)
</p><p>BEE NEWS NARRATOR:
</p><p>Hive at Five, the hive's only
</p><p>full-hour action news source.
</p><p>BEE PROTESTOR:
</p><p>No more bee beards!
</p><p>BEE NEWS NARRATOR:
</p><p>With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Weather with Storm Stinger.

</p><p>BOB BUMBLE:

</p><p>JEANETTE CHUNG:
</p><p>
</p><p>- And I'm Jeanette Chung.
</p><p>BOB BUMBLE:
</p><p>A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
</p><p> :
</p><p>intends to sue the human race
</p><p>for stealing our honey,
</p><p> :
</p><p>packaging it and profiting
</p><p>from it illegally!
</p><p>JEANETTE CHUNG:
</p><p>Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
</p><p> :
</p><p>we'll have three former queens here in
</p><p>our studio, discussing their new book,
</p><p> :
</p><p>Classy Ladies,
</p><p>out this week on Hexagon.
</p><p>(The scene changes to an interview on the news with Bee version of Larry
</p><p>King and Barry)
</p><p>BEE LARRY KING:
</p><p>Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
</p><p>from the hive. I can't do this"?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Bees have never been afraid
</p><p>to change the world.
</p><p> :
</p><p>What about Bee Columbus?
</p><p>Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
</p><p>BEE LARRY KING:
</p><p>Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>We were thinking
</p><p>of stickball or candy stores.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>How old are you?
</p><p>BEE LARRY KING:
</p><p>The bee community
</p><p>is supporting you in this case,
</p><p> :
</p><p>which will be the trial
</p><p>of the bee century.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You know, they have a Larry King
</p><p>in the human world too.
</p><p>BEE LARRY KING:
</p><p>It's a common name. Next week...
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>He looks like you and has a show
</p><p>and suspenders and colored dots...
</p><p>BEE LARRY KING:
</p><p>Next week...
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
</p><p>guest even though you just heard 'em.
</p><p>BEE LARRY KING:
</p><p>Bear Week next week!
</p><p>They're scary, hairy and here, live.
</p><p>(Bee Larry King gets annoyed and flies away offscreen)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
</p><p>squinty eyes, very Jewish.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time. We see Vanessa enter and Ken enters behind her.
</p><p>They are arguing)
</p><p>
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>In tennis, you attack
</p><p>at the point of weakness!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
</p><p>KEN==
</p><p>Honey, her backhand's a joke!
</p><p>I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(To Ken)
</p><p>Quiet, please.
</p><p>Actual work going on here.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(Pointing at Barry)
</p><p>- Is that that same bee?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Yes, it is!
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm helping him sue the human race.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Hello.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>- Hello, bee.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>This is Ken.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Recalling the "Winter Boots" incident earlier)
</p><p>Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
</p><p>ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(To Vanessa)
</p><p>Why does he talk again?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>
</p><p>Listen, you better go
</p><p>'cause we're really busy working.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>But it's our yogurt night!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(Holding door open for Ken)
</p><p>Bye-bye.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(Yelling)
</p><p>Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
</p><p>(Ken leaves and Vanessa walks over to Barry. His workplace is a mess)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You poor thing.
</p><p>You two have been at this for hours!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yes, and Adam here
</p><p>has been a huge help.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Frosting...
</p><p>- How many sugars?
</p><p> ==BARRY==
</p><p>Just one. I try not
</p><p>to use the competition.
</p><p> :
</p><p>So why are you helping me?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Bees have good qualities.
</p><p> :
</p><p>And it takes my mind off the shop.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Instead of flowers, people
</p><p>are giving balloon bouquets now.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>Those are great, if you're three.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>And artificial flowers.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Yeah, me too.
</p><p> :
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Bees must hate those fake things!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Nothing worse
</p><p>than a daffodil that's had work done.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Maybe this could make up
</p><p>for it a little bit.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I guess.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>You sure you want to go through with it?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Am I sure? When I'm done with
</p><p>the humans, they won't be able
</p><p> :
</p><p>to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
</p><p>without paying a royalty!
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and we are watching the human news. The camera shows
</p><p>
</p><p>a crowd outside a courthouse)
</p><p>NEWS REPORTER:
</p><p>It's an incredible scene
</p><p>here in downtown Manhattan,
</p><p> :
</p><p>where the world anxiously waits,
</p><p>because for the first time in history,
</p><p> :
</p><p>we will hear for ourselves
</p><p>if a honeybee can actually speak.
</p><p>(We are no longer watching through a news camera)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>What have we gotten into here, Barry?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It's pretty big, isn't it?
</p><p>ADAM==
</p><p>(Looking at the hundreds of people around the courthouse)
</p><p>I can't believe how many humans
</p><p>don't work during the day.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You think billion-dollar multinational
</p><p>food companies have good lawyers?
</p><p>SECURITY GUARD:
</p><p>Everybody needs to stay
</p><p>behind the barricade.
</p><p>(A limousine drives up and a fat man,Layton Montgomery, a honey industry
</p><p>owner gets out and walks past Barry)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- What's the matter?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I don't know, I just got a chill.
</p><p>(Fast forward in time and everyone is in the court)
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Well, if it isn't the bee team.
</p><p>
</p><p>(To Honey Industry lawyers)
</p><p>You boys work on this?
</p><p>MAN:
</p><p>All rise! The Honorable
</p><p>Judge Bumbleton presiding.
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>All right. Case number 4475,
</p><p> :
</p><p>Superior Court of New York,
</p><p>Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
</p><p> :
</p><p>is now in session.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
</p><p>the five food companies collectively?
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>A privilege.
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>Mr. Benson... you're representing
</p><p>all the bees of the world?
</p><p>(Everyone looks closely, they are waiting to see if a Bee can really talk)
</p><p>(Barry makes several buzzing sounds to sound like a Bee)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
</p><p>we're ready to proceed.
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLBETON:
</p><p>Mr. Montgomery,
</p><p>your opening statement, please.
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
</p><p> :
</p><p>my grandmother was a simple woman.
</p><p> :
</p><p>
</p><p>Born on a farm, she believed
</p><p>it was man's divine right
</p><p> :
</p><p>to benefit from the bounty
</p><p>of nature God put before us.
</p><p> :
</p><p>If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
</p><p>Mr. Benson imagines,
</p><p> :
</p><p>just think of what would it mean.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I would have to negotiate
</p><p>with the silkworm
</p><p> :
</p><p>for the elastic in my britches!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Talking bee!
</p><p>(Montgomery walks over and looks closely at Barry)
</p><p> :
</p><p>How do we know this isn't some sort of
</p><p> :
</p><p>holographic motion-picture-capture
</p><p>Hollywood wizardry?
</p><p> :
</p><p>They could be using laser beams!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Robotics! Ventriloquism!
</p><p>Cloning! For all we know,
</p><p> :
</p><p>he could be on steroids!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>Mr. Benson?
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,
</p><p>there's no trickery here.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm just an ordinary bee.
</p><p>Honey's pretty important to me.
</p><p> :
</p><p>It's important to all bees.
</p><p>We invented it!
</p><p> :
</p><p>We make it. And we protect it
</p><p>with our lives.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Unfortunately, there are
</p><p>some people in this room
</p><p> :
</p><p>who think they can take it from us
</p><p> :
</p><p>'cause we're the little guys!
</p><p>I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
</p><p> :
</p><p>you'll see how, by taking our honey,
</p><p>you not only take everything we have
</p><p> :
</p><p>but everything we are!
</p><p>JANET==
</p><p>(To Martin)
</p><p>I wish he'd dress like that
</p><p>all the time. So nice!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>Call your first witness.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
</p><p>
</p><p>of Honey Farms, big company you have.
</p><p>KLAUSS VANDERHAYDEN:
</p><p>I suppose so.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I see you also own
</p><p>Honeyburton and Honron!
</p><p>KLAUSS:
</p><p>Yes, they provide beekeepers
</p><p>for our farms.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Beekeeper. I find that
</p><p>to be a very disturbing term.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I don't imagine you employ
</p><p>any bee-free-ers, do you?
</p><p>KLAUSS:
</p><p>(Quietly)
</p><p>- No.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I couldn't hear you.
</p><p>KLAUSS:
</p><p>- No.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- No.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Because you don't free bees.
</p><p>You keep bees. Not only that,
</p><p> :
</p><p>it seems you thought a bear would be
</p><p>an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
</p><p>KLAUSS:
</p><p>They're very lovable creatures.
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You mean like this?
</p><p>(The bear from Over The Hedge barges in through the back door and it is
</p><p>roaring and standing on its hind legs. It is thrashing its claws and people
</p><p>are screaming. It is being held back by a guard who has the bear on a
</p><p>chain)
</p><p> :
</p><p>(Pointing to the roaring bear)
</p><p>Bears kill bees!
</p><p> :
</p><p>How'd you like his head crashing
</p><p>through your living room?!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Biting into your couch!
</p><p>Spitting out your throw pillows!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>OK, that's enough. Take him away.
</p><p>(The bear stops roaring and thrashing and walks out)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
</p><p>Your name intrigues me.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Where have I heard it before?
</p><p>MR. STING:
</p><p>- I was with a band called The Police.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>But you've never been
</p><p>a police officer, have you?
</p><p>STING:
</p><p>No, I haven't.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>No, you haven't. And so here
</p><p>we have yet another example
</p><p> :
</p><p>of bee culture casually
</p><p>stolen by a human
</p><p> :
</p><p>for nothing more than
</p><p>a prance-about stage name.
</p><p>STING:
</p><p>Oh, please.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Because I'm feeling
</p><p>a little stung, Sting.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>That's not his real name?! You idiots!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Mr. Liotta, first,
</p><p>belated congratulations on
</p><p> :
</p><p>your Emmy win for a guest spot
</p><p>on ER in 2005.
</p><p>RAY LIOTTA:
</p><p>Thank you. Thank you.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I see from your resume
</p><p>that you're devilishly handsome
</p><p> :
</p><p>with a churning inner turmoil
</p><p>
</p><p>that's ready to blow.
</p><p>RAY LIOTTA:
</p><p>I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Not yet it isn't. But is this
</p><p>what it's come to for you?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
</p><p>so you don't
</p><p> :
</p><p>have to rehearse
</p><p>your part and learn your lines, sir?
</p><p>RAY LIOTTA:
</p><p>Watch it, Benson!
</p><p>I could blow right now!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>This isn't a goodfella.
</p><p>This is a badfella!
</p><p>(Ray Liotta looses it and tries to grab Barry)
</p><p>RAY LIOTTA:
</p><p>Why doesn't someone just step on
</p><p>this creep, and we can all go home?!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>- Order in this court!
</p><p>RAY LIOTTA:
</p><p>- You're all thinking it!
</p><p>(Judge Bumbleton starts banging her gavel)
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>Order! Order, I say!
</p><p>RAY LIOTTA:
</p><p>- Say it!
</p><p>MAN:
</p><p>
</p><p>- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
</p><p>(We see a montage of magazines which feature the court case)
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Barry is back home with Vanessa)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I think it was awfully nice
</p><p>of that bear to pitch in like that.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I think the jury's on our side.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Are we doing everything right,you know, legally?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I'm a florist.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Right. Well, here's to a great team.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>To a great team!
</p><p>(Ken walks in from work. He sees Barry and he looks upset when he sees
</p><p>Barry clinking his glass with Vanessa)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Well, hello.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Oh, Ken!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Hello!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I didn't think you were coming.
</p><p> :
</p><p>No, I was just late.
</p><p>I tried to call, but...
</p><p>(Ken holds up his phone and flips it open. The phone has no charge)
</p><p>...the battery...
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>
</p><p>I didn't want all this to go to waste,
</p><p>so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Oh, that was lucky.
</p><p>(Ken sits down at the table across from Barry and Vanessa leaves the room)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>There's a little left.
</p><p>I could heat it up.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(Not taking his eyes off Barry)
</p><p>Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm not much for the game myself.
</p><p>The ball's a little grabby.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>That's where I usually sit.
</p><p>Right...
</p><p>(Points to where Barry is sitting)
</p><p>there.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(Calling from other room)
</p><p>Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,
</p><p> :
</p><p>and he agreed with me that eating with
</p><p>chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(To Barry)
</p><p>You think I don't see what you're doing?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I know how hard it is to find
</p><p>the right job. We have that in common.
</p><p>
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Do we?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Bees have 100 percent employment,
</p><p>but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(Menacingly)
</p><p>That's just what
</p><p>I was thinking about doing.
</p><p>(Ken reaches for a fork on the table but knocks if on the floor. He goes to
</p><p>pick it up)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
</p><p>for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
</p><p>(Ken quickly rises back up after hearing this but hits his head on the
</p><p>table and yells)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I'm going to drain the old stinger.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Yeah, you do that.
</p><p>(Barry flies past Ken to get to the bathroom and Ken freaks out, splashing
</p><p>some of the wine he was using to cool his head in his eyes. He yells in
</p><p>anger)
</p><p>(Barry looks at the magazines featuring his victories in court)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Look at that.
</p><p>(Barry flies into the bathroom)
</p><p>(He puts his hand on his head but this makes hurts him and makes him even
</p><p>madder. He yells again)
</p><p>(Barry is washing his hands in the sink but then Ken walks in)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>You know, you know I've just about had it
</p><p>(Closes bathroom door behind him)
</p><p>with your little mind games.
</p><p>(Ken is menacingly rolling up a magazine)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>(Backing away)
</p><p>- What's that?
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>- Italian Vogue.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>It's a lot of ads.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Remember what Van said, why is
</p><p>your life more valuable than mine?
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>That's funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
</p><p>(Ken smashes everything off the sink with the magazine and Barry narrowly
</p><p>escapes)
</p><p>(Ken follows Barry around and tries to hit him with the magazine but he
</p><p>keeps missing)
</p><p>(Ken gets a spray bottle)
</p><p> :
</p><p>I think something stinks in here!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Enjoying the spray)
</p><p>I love the smell of flowers.
</p><p>(Ken holds a lighter in front of the spray bottle)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>How do you like the smell of flames?!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Not as much.
</p><p>(Ken fires his make-shift flamethrower but misses Barry, burning the
</p><p>bathroom. He torches the whole room but looses his footing and falls into
</p><p>the bathtub. After getting hit in the head by falling objects 3 times he
</p><p>picks up the shower head, revealing a Water bug hiding under it)
</p><p>WATER BUG:
</p><p>Water bug! Not taking sides!
</p><p>
</p><p>(Barry gets up out of a pile of bathroom supplies and he is wearing a
</p><p>chapstick hat)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
</p><p>This is pathetic!
</p><p>(Ken switches the shower head to lethal)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>I've got issues!
</p><p>(Ken sprays Barry with the shower head and he crash lands into the toilet)
</p><p>(Ken menacingly looks down into the toilet at Barry)
</p><p>Well, well, well, a royal flush!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- You're bluffing.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>- Am I?
</p><p>(flushes toilet)
</p><p>(Barry grabs a chapstick from the toilet seat and uses it to surf in the
</p><p>flushing toilet)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Surf's up, dude!
</p><p>(Barry flies out of the toilet on the chapstick and sprays Ken's face with
</p><p>the toilet water)
</p><p> :
</p><p>EW,Poo water!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>That bowl is gnarly.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>(Aiming a toilet cleaner at Barry)
</p><p>Except for those dirty yellow rings!
</p><p>(Barry cowers and covers his head and Vanessa runs in and takes the toilet
</p><p>cleaner from Ken just before he hits Barry)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Kenneth! What are you doing?!
</p><p>KEN==
</p><p>(Leaning towards Barry)
</p><p>
</p><p>You know, I don't even like honey!
</p><p>I don't eat it!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>We need to talk!
</p><p>(Vanessa pulls Ken out of the bathroom)
</p><p> :
</p><p>He's just a little bee!
</p><p> :
</p><p>And he happens to be
</p><p>the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Long time? What are you talking about?!
</p><p>Are there other bugs in your life?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>No, but there are other things bugging
</p><p>me in life. And you're one of them!
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
</p><p> :
</p><p>My nerves are fried from riding
</p><p>on this emotional roller coaster!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Goodbye, Ken.
</p><p>(Ken huffs and walks out and slams the door. But suddenly he walks back in
</p><p>and stares at Barry)
</p><p> :
</p><p>And for your information,
</p><p>I prefer sugar-free, artificial
</p><p>sweeteners MADE BY MAN!
</p><p>(Ken leaves again and Vanessa leans in towards Barry)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I'm sorry about all that.
</p><p>(Ken walks back in again)
</p><p>
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>I know it's got
</p><p>an aftertaste! I LIKE IT!
</p><p>(Ken leaves for the last time)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I always felt there was some kind
</p><p>of barrier between Ken and me.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I couldn't overcome it.
</p><p>Oh, well.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Are you OK for the trial?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I believe Mr. Montgomery
</p><p>is about out of ideas.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Barry, Adam, and Vanessa are back in court)
</p><p>MONTGOMERY--
</p><p>We would like to call
</p><p>Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Good idea! You can really see why he's
</p><p>considered one of the best lawyers...
</p><p>(Barry stares at Adam)
</p><p>...Yeah.
</p><p>LAWYER:
</p><p>Layton, you've
</p><p>gotta weave some magic
</p><p>with this jury,
</p><p>or it's gonna be all over.
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Don't worry. The only thing I have
</p><p>to do to turn this jury around
</p><p> :
</p><p>is to remind them
</p><p>of what they don't like about bees.
</p><p>(To lawyer)
</p><p>
</p><p>- You got the tweezers?
</p><p>LAWYER:
</p><p>- Are you allergic?
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
</p><p>what I think we'd all like to know.
</p><p> :
</p><p>What exactly is your relationship
</p><p>(Points to Vanessa)
</p><p> :
</p><p>to that woman?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>We're friends.
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>- Good friends?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yes.
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>How good? Do you live together?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Wait a minute...
</p><p> :
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Are you her little...
</p><p> :
</p><p>...bedbug?
</p><p>(Adam's stinger starts vibrating. He is agitated)
</p><p>I've seen a bee documentary or two.
</p><p>From what I understand,
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>doesn't your queen give birth
</p><p>to all the bee children?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yeah, but...
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>(Pointing at Janet and Martin)
</p><p>- So those aren't your real parents!
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>- Oh, Barry...
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yes, they are!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Hold me back!
</p><p>(Vanessa tries to hold Adam back. He wants to sting Montgomery)
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>You're an illegitimate bee,
</p><p>aren't you, Benson?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>He's denouncing bees!
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Don't y'all date your cousins?
</p><p>(Montgomery leans over on the jury stand and stares at Adam)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Objection!
</p><p>(Vanessa raises her hand to object but Adam gets free. He flies straight at
</p><p>Montgomery)
</p><p>=ADAM:
</p><p>- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
</p><p>(Adam stings Montgomery in the butt and he starts thrashing around)
</p><p>
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Oh, I'm hit!!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Oh, lordy, I am hit!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>(Banging gavel)
</p><p>Order! Order!
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>(Overreacting)
</p><p>The venom! The venom
</p><p>is coursing through my veins!
</p><p> :
</p><p>I have been felled
</p><p>by a winged beast of destruction!
</p><p> :
</p><p>You see? You can't treat them
</p><p>like equals! They're striped savages!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Stinging's the only thing
</p><p>they know! It's their way!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Adam, stay with me.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- I can't feel my legs.
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>(Overreacting and throwing his body around the room)
</p><p>What angel of mercy
</p><p>will come forward to suck the poison
</p><p> :
</p><p>from my heaving buttocks?
</p><p>JUDGE BUMLBETON:
</p><p>I will have order in this court. Order!
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>Order, please!
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and we see a human news reporter)
</p><p>NEWS REPORTER:
</p><p>The case of the honeybees
</p><p>versus the human race
</p><p> :
</p><p>took a pointed turn against the bees
</p><p> :
</p><p>yesterday when one of their legal
</p><p>team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
</p><p>(Adam is laying in a hospital bed and Barry flies in to see him)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Hey, buddy.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Hey.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Is there much pain?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Yeah.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I...
</p><p> :
</p><p>I blew the whole case, didn't I?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It doesn't matter. What matters is
</p><p>you're alive. You could have died.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
</p><p>(A small plastic sword is replaced as Adam's stinger)
</p><p>They got it from the cafeteria
</p><p>downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>Look, there's
</p><p>a little celery still on it.
</p><p>(Flicks off the celery and sighs)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What was it like to sting someone?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>I can't explain it. It was all...
</p><p> :
</p><p>All adrenaline and then...
</p><p>and then ecstasy!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>...All right.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>You think it was all a trap?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Of course. I'm sorry.
</p><p>I flew us right into this.
</p><p> :
</p><p>What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
</p><p>just a couple of bugs in this world.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>What will the humans do to us
</p><p>if they win?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I don't know.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>I hear they put the roaches in motels.
</p><p>That doesn't sound so bad.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Adam, they check in,
</p><p>but they don't check out!
</p><p>
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Oh, my.
</p><p>(Coughs)
</p><p>Could you get a nurse
</p><p>to close that window?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Why?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- The smoke.
</p><p>(We can see that two humans are smoking cigarettes outside)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Bees don't smoke.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Right. Bees don't smoke.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Bees don't smoke!
</p><p>But some bees are smoking.
</p><p> :
</p><p>That's it! That's our case!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>It is? It's not over?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Get back to the court and stall.
</p><p>Stall any way you can.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Adam is making a paper boat in the courtroom)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>And assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub!
</p><p>(We see that the jury have each made their own paper boats after being
</p><p>taught how by Adam. They all look confused)
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>
</p><p>Mr. Flayman.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>Where is the rest of your team?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>(Continues stalling)
</p><p>Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
</p><p> :
</p><p>and as a result,
</p><p>we don't make very good time.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I actually heard a funny story about...
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Your Honor,
</p><p>haven't these ridiculous bugs
</p><p> :
</p><p>taken up enough
</p><p>of this court's valuable time?
</p><p> :
</p><p>How much longer will we allow
</p><p>these absurd shenanigans to go on?
</p><p> :
</p><p>They have presented no compelling
</p><p>evidence to support their charges
</p><p> :
</p><p>against my clients,
</p><p>who run legitimate businesses.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I move for a complete dismissal
</p><p>
</p><p>of this entire case!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
</p><p> :
</p><p>to have to consider
</p><p>Mr. Montgomery's motion.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>But you can't! We have a terrific case.
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>Where is your proof?
</p><p>Where is the evidence?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Show me the smoking gun!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Barry flies in through the door)
</p><p>Hold it, Your Honor!
</p><p>You want a smoking gun?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Here is your smoking gun.
</p><p>(Vanessa walks in holding a bee smoker. She sets it down on the Judge's
</p><p>podium)
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>What is that?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It's a bee smoker!
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>(Picks up smoker)
</p><p>What, this?
</p><p>This harmless little contraption?
</p><p> :
</p><p>This couldn't hurt a fly,
</p><p>let alone a bee.
</p><p>(Montgomery accidentally fires it at the bees in the crowd and they faint
</p><p>
</p><p>and cough)
</p><p>(Dozens of reporters start taking pictures of the suffering bees)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Look at what has happened
</p><p> :
</p><p>to bees who have never been asked,
</p><p>"Smoking or non?"
</p><p> :
</p><p>Is this what nature intended for us?
</p><p> :
</p><p>To be forcibly addicted
</p><p>to smoke machines
</p><p> :
</p><p>and man-made wooden slat work camps?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Living out our lives as honey slaves
</p><p>to the white man?
</p><p>(Barry points to the honey industry owners. One of them is an African
</p><p>American so he awkwardly separates himself from the others)
</p><p>LAWYER:
</p><p>- What are we gonna do?
</p><p>- He's playing the species card.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, please,
</p><p>free these bees!
</p><p>ADAM AND VANESSA:
</p><p>Free the bees! Free the bees!
</p><p>BEES IN CROWD:
</p><p>Free the bees!
</p><p>HUMAN JURY:
</p><p>Free the bees! Free the bees!
</p><p>JUDGE BUMBLETON:
</p><p>The court finds in favor of the bees!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Vanessa, we won!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I knew you could do it! High-five!
</p><p>(Vanessa hits Barry hard because her hand is too big)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Sorry.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Overjoyed)
</p><p>I'm OK! You know what this means?
</p><p> :
</p><p>All the honey
</p><p>will finally belong to the bees.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Now we won't have
</p><p>to work so hard all the time.
</p><p>MONTGOMERY:
</p><p>This is an unholy perversion
</p><p>of the balance of nature, Benson.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You'll regret this.
</p><p>(Montgomery leaves and Barry goes outside the courtroom. Several reporters
</p><p>start asking Barry questions)
</p><p>REPORTER 1#:
</p><p>Barry, how much honey is out there?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>All right. One at a time.
</p><p>REPORTER 2#:
</p><p>Barry, who are you wearing?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
</p><p>and I have no pants.
</p><p>
</p><p>(Barry flies outside with the paparazzi and Adam and Vanessa stay back)
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>(To Vanessa)
</p><p>- What if Montgomery's right?
</p><p>Vanessa:
</p><p>- What do you mean?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>We've been living the bee way
</p><p>a long time, 27 million years.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Barry is talking to a man)
</p><p>BUSINESS MAN:
</p><p>Congratulations on your victory.
</p><p>What will you demand as a settlement?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
</p><p>of all bee work camps.
</p><p>(As Barry is talking we see a montage of men putting "closed" tape over the
</p><p>work camps and freeing the bees in the crappy apartments)
</p><p>Then we want back the honey
</p><p>that was ours to begin with,
</p><p> :
</p><p>every last drop.
</p><p>(Men in suits are pushing all the honey of the aisle and into carts)
</p><p>We demand an end to the glorification
</p><p>of the bear as anything more
</p><p>(We see a statue of a bear-shaped honey container being pulled down by
</p><p>bees)
</p><p>than a filthy, smelly,
</p><p>bad-breath stink machine.
</p><p> :
</p><p>We're all aware
</p><p>of what they do in the woods.
</p><p>(We see Winnie the Pooh sharing his honey with Piglet in the cross-hairs of
</p><p>a high-tech sniper rifle)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Looking through binoculars)
</p><p>
</p><p>Wait for my signal.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Take him out.
</p><p>(Winnie gets hit by a tranquilizer dart and dramatically falls off the log
</p><p>he was standing on, his tongue hanging out. Piglet looks at Pooh in fear
</p><p>and the Sniper takes the honey.)
</p><p>SNIPER:
</p><p>He'll have nausea
</p><p>for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>And we will no longer tolerate
</p><p>bee-negative nicknames...
</p><p>(Mr. Sting is sitting at home until he is taken out of his house by the men
</p><p>in suits)
</p><p>STING:
</p><p>But it's just a prance-about stage name!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>...unnecessary inclusion of honey
</p><p>in bogus health products
</p><p> :
</p><p>and la-dee-da human
</p><p>tea-time snack garnishments.
</p><p>(An old lady is mixing honey into her tea but suddenly men in suits smash
</p><p>her face down on the table and take the honey)
</p><p>OLD LADY:
</p><p>Can't breathe.
</p><p>(A honey truck pulls up to Barry's hive)
</p><p>WORKER:
</p><p>Bring it in, boys!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Hold it right there! Good.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Tap it.
</p><p>
</p><p>(Tons of honey is being pumped into the hive's storage)
</p><p>BEE WORKER 1#:
</p><p>(Honey overflows from the cup)
</p><p>Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
</p><p>and there's gallons more coming!
</p><p> :
</p><p>- I think we need to shut down!
</p><p>=BEE WORKER #2=
</p><p>- Shut down? We've never shut down.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Shut down honey production!
</p><p>DEAN BUZZWELL:
</p><p>Stop making honey!
</p><p>(The bees all leave their stations. Two bees run into a room and they put
</p><p>the keys into a machine)
</p><p>Turn your key, sir!
</p><p>(Two worker bees dramatically turn their keys, which opens the button which
</p><p>they press, shutting down the honey-making machines. This is the first time
</p><p>this has ever happened)
</p><p>BEE:
</p><p>...What do we do now?
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and a Bee is about to jump into a pool full of
</p><p>honey)
</p><p>Cannonball!
</p><p>(The bee gets stuck in the honey and we get a short montage of Bees leaving
</p><p>work)
</p><p>(We see the Pollen Jocks flying but one of them gets a call on his antenna)
</p><p>LOU LU DUVA:
</p><p>(Through "phone")
</p><p>We're shutting honey production!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Mission abort.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
</p><p>Returning to base.
</p><p>(The Pollen Jocks fly back to the hive)
</p><p>
</p><p>(We get a time lapse of Central Park slowly wilting away as the bees all
</p><p>relax)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Adam, you wouldn't believe
</p><p>how much honey was out there.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Oh, yeah?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What's going on? Where is everybody?
</p><p>(The entire street is deserted)
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Are they out celebrating?
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- They're home.
</p><p> :
</p><p>They don't know what to do.
</p><p>Laying out, sleeping in.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
</p><p>to San Antonio with a cricket.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>At least we got our honey back.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Sometimes I think, so what if humans
</p><p>liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
</p><p> :
</p><p>It's the greatest thing in the world!
</p><p>I was excited to be part of making it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>This was my new desk. This was my
</p><p>new job. I wanted to do it really well.
</p><p> :
</p><p>
</p><p>And now...
</p><p> :
</p><p>Now I can't.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Barry is talking to Vanessa)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I don't understand
</p><p>why they're not happy.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I thought their lives would be better!
</p><p> :
</p><p>They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
</p><p>Honey really changes people.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You don't have any idea
</p><p>what's going on, do you?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- What did you want to show me?
</p><p>(Vanessa takes Barry to the rooftop where they first had coffee and points
</p><p>to her store)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- This.
</p><p>(Points at her flowers. They are all grey and wilting)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What happened here?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>That is not the half of it.
</p><p>(Small flash forward in time and Vanessa and Barry are on the roof of her
</p><p>store and she points to Central Park)
</p><p>(We see that Central Park is no longer green and colorful, rather it is
</p><p>grey, brown, and dead-like. It is very depressing to look at)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Oh, no. Oh, my.
</p><p> :
</p><p>
</p><p>They're all wilting.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Doesn't look very good, does it?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>No.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>And whose fault do you think that is?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
</p><p>VANESSA==
</p><p>(Staring at Barry)
</p><p>Bees?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Specifically, me.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I didn't think bees not needing to make
</p><p>honey would affect all these things.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>It's not just flowers.
</p><p>Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>That's our whole SAT test right there.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Take away produce, that affects
</p><p>the entire animal kingdom.
</p><p> :
</p><p>And then, of course...
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>The human species?
</p><p> :
</p><p>So if there's no more pollination,
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>it could all just go south here,
</p><p>couldn't it?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I know this is also partly my fault.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>How about a suicide pact?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>How do we do it?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I'll sting you, you step on me.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- That just kills you twice.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Right, right.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Listen, Barry...
</p><p>sorry, but I gotta get going.
</p><p>(Vanessa leaves)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(To himself)
</p><p>I had to open my mouth and talk.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Vanessa?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
</p><p>Where are you going?
</p><p>(Vanessa is getting into a taxi)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>To the final Tournament of Roses parade
</p><p>in Pasadena.
</p><p> :
</p><p>
</p><p>They've moved it to this weekend
</p><p>because all the flowers are dying.
</p><p> :
</p><p>It's the last chance
</p><p>I'll ever have to see it.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
</p><p>I never meant it to turn out like this.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I know. Me neither.
</p><p>(The taxi starts to drive away)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Tournament of Roses.
</p><p>Roses can't do sports.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Roses!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Vanessa!
</p><p>(Barry flies after the Taxi)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Roses?!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Barry?
</p><p>(Barry is flying outside the window of the taxi)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Roses are flowers!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Yes, they are.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Flowers, bees, pollen!
</p><p>
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I know.
</p><p>That's why this is the last parade.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Maybe not.
</p><p>Could you ask him to slow down?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Could you slow down?
</p><p>(The taxi driver screeches to a stop and Barry keeps flying forward)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Barry!
</p><p>(Barry flies back to the window)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>OK, I made a huge mistake.
</p><p>This is a total disaster, all my fault.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Yes, it kind of is.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I've ruined the planet.
</p><p>I wanted to help you
</p><p> :
</p><p>with the flower shop.
</p><p>I've made it worse.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Actually, it's completely closed down.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I thought maybe you were remodeling.
</p><p> :
</p><p>But I have another idea, and it's
</p><p>greater than my previous ideas combined.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I don't want to hear it!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>All right, they have the roses,
</p><p>the roses have the pollen.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I know every bee, plant
</p><p>and flower bud in this park.
</p><p> :
</p><p>All we gotta do is get what they've got
</p><p>back here with what we've got.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Bees.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Park.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Pollen!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Flowers.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Re-pollination!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Across the nation!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Tournament of Roses,
</p><p>Pasadena, California.
</p><p> :
</p><p>They've got nothing
</p><p>but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Security will be tight.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I have an idea.
</p><p>
</p><p>(Flash forward in time. Vanessa is about to board a plane which has all the
</p><p>Roses on board.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
</p><p>(Holds out badge)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Official floral business. It's real.
</p><p>SECURITY GUARD:
</p><p>Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
</p><p>=VANESSA==
</p><p>Thank you. It was a gift.
</p><p>(Barry is revealed to be hiding inside the brooch)
</p><p>(Flash back in time and Barry and Vanessa are discussing their plan)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Once inside,
</p><p>we just pick the right float.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>How about The Princess and the Pea?
</p><p> :
</p><p>I could be the princess,
</p><p>and you could be the pea!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yes, I got it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Where should I sit?
</p><p>GUARD:
</p><p>- What are you?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I believe I'm the pea.
</p><p>GUARD:
</p><p>- The pea?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>
</p><p>It goes under the mattresses.
</p><p>GUARD:
</p><p>- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
</p><p>- I'm getting the marshal.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You do that!
</p><p>This whole parade is a fiasco!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Let's see what this baby'll do.
</p><p>(Vanessa drives the float through traffic)
</p><p>GUARD:
</p><p>Hey, what are you doing?!
</p><p>BARRY==
</p><p>Then all we do
</p><p>is blend in with traffic...
</p><p> :
</p><p>...without arousing suspicion.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Once at the airport,
</p><p>there's no stopping us.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are about to get on a plane)
</p><p>SECURITY GUARD:
</p><p>Stop! Security.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- You and your insect pack your float?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Yes.
</p><p>SECURITY GUARD:
</p><p>Has it been
</p><p>in your possession the entire time?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Yes.
</p><p>
</p><p>SECURITY GUARD:
</p><p>Would you remove your shoes?
</p><p>(To Barry)
</p><p>- Remove your stinger.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- It's part of me.
</p><p>SECURITY GUARD:
</p><p>I know. Just having some fun.
</p><p>Enjoy your flight.
</p><p>(Barry plotting with Vanessa)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Then if we're lucky, we'll have
</p><p>just enough pollen to do the job.
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are flying on the plane)
</p><p>Can you believe how lucky we are? We
</p><p>have just enough pollen to do the job!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I think this is gonna work.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It's got to work.
</p><p>CAPTAIN SCOTT:
</p><p>(On intercom)
</p><p>Attention, passengers,
</p><p>this is Captain Scott.
</p><p> :
</p><p>We have a bit of bad weather
</p><p>in New York.
</p><p> :
</p><p>It looks like we'll experience
</p><p>a couple hours delay.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Barry, these are cut flowers
</p><p>with no water. They'll never make it.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>I gotta get up there
</p><p>and talk to them.
</p><p>VANESSA==
</p><p>Be careful.
</p><p>(Barry flies right outside the cockpit door)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Can I get help
</p><p>with the Sky Mall magazine?
</p><p>I'd like to order the talking
</p><p>inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
</p><p>(The flight attendant opens the door and walks out and Barry flies into the
</p><p>cockpit unseen)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Captain, I'm in a real situation.
</p><p>CAPTAIN SCOTT:
</p><p>- What'd you say, Hal?
</p><p>CO-PILOT HAL:
</p><p>- Nothing.
</p><p>(Scott notices Barry and freaks out)
</p><p>CAPTAIN SCOTT:
</p><p>Bee!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>No,no,no, Don't freak out! My entire species...
</p><p>(Captain Scott gets out of his seat and tries to suck Barry into a handheld
</p><p>vacuum)
</p><p>HAL:
</p><p>(To Scott)
</p><p>What are you doing?
</p><p>(Barry lands on Hals hair but Scott sees him. He tries to suck up Barry but
</p><p>instead he sucks up Hals toupee)
</p><p>CAPTAIN SCOTT:
</p><p>Uh-oh.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
</p><p>
</p><p>HAL:
</p><p>(Hal doesn't know Barry is on his head)
</p><p>- Who's an attorney?
</p><p>CAPTAIN SCOTT:
</p><p>Don't move.
</p><p>(Scott hits Hal in the face with the vacuum in an attempt to hit Barry. Hal
</p><p>is knocked out and he falls on the life raft button which launches an
</p><p>infalatable boat into Scott, who gets knocked out and falls to the floor.
</p><p>They are both uncounscious.)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(To himself)
</p><p>Oh, Barry.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(On intercom, with a Southern accent)
</p><p>Good afternoon, passengers.
</p><p>This is your captain.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
</p><p>please report to the cockpit?
</p><p>(Vanessa looks confused)
</p><p>(Normal accent)
</p><p>...And please hurry!
</p><p>(Vanessa opens the door and sees the life raft and the uncounscious pilots)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>What happened here?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I tried to talk to them, but
</p><p>then there was a DustBuster,
</p><p>a toupee, a life raft exploded.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Now one's bald, one's in a boat,
</p><p>and they're both unconscious!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>...Is that another bee joke?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>- No!
</p><p> :
</p><p>No one's flying the plane!
</p><p>BUD DITCHWATER:
</p><p>(Through radio on plane)
</p><p>This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
</p><p>What's your status?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>This is Vanessa Bloome.
</p><p>I'm a florist from New York.
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>Where's the pilot?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>He's unconscious,
</p><p>and so is the copilot.
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>Not good. Does anyone onboard
</p><p>have flight experience?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>As a matter of fact, there is.
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>- Who's that?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Barry Benson.
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Vanessa, this is nothing more
</p><p>than a big metal bee.
</p><p> :
</p><p>It's got giant wings, huge engines.
</p><p>
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I can't fly a plane.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Yes.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>How hard could it be?
</p><p>(Vanessa sits down and flies for a little bit but we see lightning clouds
</p><p>outside the window)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Wait, Barry!
</p><p>We're headed into some lightning.
</p><p>(An ominous lightning storm looms in front of the plane)
</p><p>(We are now watching the Bee News)
</p><p>BOB BUMBLE:
</p><p>This is Bob Bumble. We have some
</p><p>late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
</p><p> :
</p><p>where a suspenseful scene
</p><p>is developing.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Barry Benson,
</p><p>fresh from his legal victory...
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>That's Barry!
</p><p>BOB BUMBLE:
</p><p>...is attempting to land a plane,
</p><p>loaded with people, flowers
</p><p> :
</p><p>and an incapacitated flight crew.
</p><p>JANET, MARTIN, UNCLE CAR AND ADAM:
</p><p>Flowers?!
</p><p>(The scene switches to the human news)
</p><p>
</p><p>REPORTER:
</p><p>(Talking with Bob Bumble)
</p><p>We have a storm in the area
</p><p>and two individuals at the controls
</p><p> :
</p><p>with absolutely no flight experience.
</p><p>BOB BUMBLE:
</p><p>Just a minute.
</p><p>There's a bee on that plane.
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
</p><p>and his no-account compadres.
</p><p> :
</p><p>They've done enough damage.
</p><p>REPORTER:
</p><p>But isn't he your only hope?
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>Technically, a bee
</p><p>shouldn't be able to fly at all.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Their wings are too small...
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Through radio)
</p><p>Haven't we heard this a million times?
</p><p> :
</p><p>"The surface area of the wings
</p><p>and body mass make no sense."...
</p><p>BOB BUMBLE:
</p><p>- Get this on the air!
</p><p>BEE:
</p><p>- Got it.
</p><p>
</p><p>BEE NEWS CREW:
</p><p>- Stand by.
</p><p>BEE NEWS CREW:
</p><p>- We're going live!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Through radio on TV)
</p><p>...The way we work may be a mystery to you.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Making honey takes a lot of bees
</p><p>doing a lot of small jobs.
</p><p> :
</p><p>But let me tell you about a small job.
</p><p> :
</p><p>If you do it well,
</p><p>it makes a big difference.
</p><p> :
</p><p>More than we realized.
</p><p>To us, to everyone.
</p><p> :
</p><p>That's why I want to get bees
</p><p>back to working together.
</p><p> :
</p><p>That's the bee way!
</p><p>We're not made of Jell-O.
</p><p> :
</p><p>We get behind a fellow.
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Black and yellow!
</p><p>BEES:
</p><p>- Hello!
</p><p>(The scene switches and Barry is teaching Vanessa how to fly)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>
</p><p>Left, right, down, hover.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Hover?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Forget hover.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>This isn't so hard.
</p><p>(Pretending to honk the horn)
</p><p>Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
</p><p>(A Lightning bolt hits the plane and autopilot turns off)
</p><p>Barry, what happened?!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Wait, I think we were
</p><p>on autopilot the whole time.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- That may have been helping me.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- And now we're not!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
</p><p>(The plane plummets but we see Lou Lu Duva and the Pollen Jocks, along with
</p><p>multiple other bees flying towards the plane)
</p><p>Lou Lu DUva:
</p><p>All of you, let's get
</p><p>behind this fellow! Move it out!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Move out!
</p><p>(The scene switches back to Vanessa and Barry in the plane)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
</p><p>you copy me with the wings of the plane!
</p><p>(Barry sticks out his arms like an airplane and flys in front of Vanessa's
</p><p>face)
</p><p>
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Don't have to yell.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I'm not yelling!
</p><p>We're in a lot of trouble.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>It's very hard to concentrate
</p><p>with that panicky tone in your voice!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I can't do this!
</p><p>(Barry slaps Vanessa)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Vanessa, pull yourself together.
</p><p>You have to snap out of it!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(Slaps Barry)
</p><p>You snap out of it.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Slaps Vanessa)
</p><p> :
</p><p>You snap out of it.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- You snap out of it!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- You snap out of it!
</p><p>(We see that all the Pollen Jocks are flying under the plane)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- You snap out of it!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- You snap out of it!
</p><p>
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- You snap out of it!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- You snap out of it!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Hold it!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Why? Come on, it's my turn.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>How is the plane flying?
</p><p>(The plane is now safely flying)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>I don't know.
</p><p>(Barry's antennae rings like a phone. Barry picks up)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Hello?
</p><p>LOU LU DUVA:
</p><p>(Through "phone")
</p><p>Benson, got any flowers
</p><p>for a happy occasion in there?
</p><p>(All of the Pollen Jocks are carrying the plane)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>The Pollen Jocks!
</p><p> :
</p><p>They do get behind a fellow.
</p><p>LOU LU DUVA:
</p><p>- Black and yellow.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCKS:
</p><p>- Hello.
</p><p>LOU LU DUVA:
</p><p>All right, let's drop this tin can
</p><p>
</p><p>on the blacktop.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Thinking bee.
</p><p>- Thinking bee.
</p><p>(On the runway there are millions of bees laying on their backs)
</p><p>BEES:
</p><p>Thinking bee!
</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Wait a minute.
</p><p>I think I'm feeling something.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- What?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Bring the nose down.
</p><p>BEES:
</p><p>Thinking bee!
</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
</p><p>CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR:
</p><p>- What in the world is on the tarmac?
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>- Get some lights on that!
</p><p>
</p><p>(It is revealed that all the bees are organized into a giant pulsating
</p><p>flower formation)
</p><p>BEES:
</p><p>Thinking bee!
</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- OK.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Out the engines. We're going in
</p><p>on bee power. Ready, boys?
</p><p>LOU LU DUVA:
</p><p>Affirmative!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Land on that flower!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Ready? Full reverse!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Spin it around!
</p><p>(The plane's nose is pointed at a flower painted on a nearby plane)
</p><p>- Not that flower! The other one!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Which one?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- That flower.
</p><p>(The plane is now pointed at a fat guy in a flowered shirt. He freaks out
</p><p>and tries to take a picture of the plane)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- I'm aiming at the flower!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
</p><p>I mean the giant pulsating flower
</p><p>made of millions of bees!
</p><p>(The plane hovers over the bee-flower)
</p><p> :
</p><p>Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Rotate around it.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- This is insane, Barry!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- This's the only way I know how to fly.
</p><p>BUD:
</p><p>Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
</p><p>flying in an insect-like pattern?
</p><p>(The plane is unrealistically hovering and spinning over the bee-flower)
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
</p><p>Smell it. Full reverse!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Just drop it. Be a part of it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Aim for the center!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Come on, already.
</p><p>(The bees scatter and the plane safely lands)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Barry, we did it!
</p><p>You taught me how to fly!
</p><p>
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Yes!
</p><p>(Vanessa is about to high-five Barry)
</p><p>No high-five!
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>- Right.
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>Barry, it worked!
</p><p>Did you see the giant flower?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>What giant flower? Where? Of course
</p><p>I saw the flower! That was genius!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>- Thank you.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- But we're not done yet.
</p><p> :
</p><p>Listen, everyone!
</p><p> :
</p><p>This runway is covered
</p><p>with the last pollen
</p><p> :
</p><p>from the last flowers
</p><p>available anywhere on Earth.
</p><p> :
</p><p>That means this is our last chance.
</p><p> :
</p><p>We're the only ones who make honey,
</p><p>pollinate flowers and dress like this.
</p><p> :
</p><p>If we're gonna survive as a species,
</p><p>this is our moment! What do you say?
</p><p>
</p><p> :
</p><p>Are we going to be bees, or just
</p><p>Museum of Natural History keychains?
</p><p>BEES:
</p><p>We're bees!
</p><p>BEE WHO LIKES KEYCHAINS:
</p><p>Keychain!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Then follow me! Except Keychain.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK #1:
</p><p>Hold on, Barry. Here.
</p><p> :
</p><p>You've earned this.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Yeah!
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
</p><p>fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
</p><p>(The Pollen Jocks throw Barry a nectar-collecting gun. Barry catches it)
</p><p>Oh, yeah.
</p><p>JANET:
</p><p>That's our Barry.
</p><p>(Barry and the Pollen Jocks get pollen from the flowers on the plane)
</p><p>(Flash forward in time and the Pollen Jocks are flying over NYC)
</p><p> :
</p><p>(Barry pollinates the flowers in Vanessa's shop and then heads to Central
</p><p>Park)
</p><p>BOY IN PARK:
</p><p>Mom! The bees are back!
</p><p>ADAM:
</p><p>(Putting on his Krelman hat)
</p><p>If anybody needs
</p><p>
</p><p>to make a call, now's the time.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I got a feeling we'll be
</p><p>working late tonight!
</p><p>(The bee honey factories are back up and running)
</p><p>(Meanwhile at Vanessa's shop)
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>(To customer)
</p><p>Here's your change. Have a great
</p><p>afternoon! Can I help who's next?
</p><p> :
</p><p>Would you like some honey with that?
</p><p>It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
</p><p>(There is a room in the shop where Barry does legal work for other animals.
</p><p>He is currently talking with a Cow)
</p><p>COW:
</p><p>Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
</p><p>And I don't see a nickel!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Sometimes I just feel
</p><p>like a piece of meat!
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I had no idea.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Barry, I'm sorry.
</p><p>Have you got a moment?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Would you excuse me?
</p><p>My mosquito associate will help you.
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Sorry I'm late.
</p><p>COW:
</p><p>He's a lawyer too?
</p><p>
</p><p>MOOSEBLOOD:
</p><p>Ma'am, I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
</p><p>All I needed was a briefcase.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Have a great afternoon!
</p><p> :
</p><p>Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
</p><p>and I can't get them anywhere.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>No problem, Vannie.
</p><p>Just leave it to me.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>You're a lifesaver, Barry.
</p><p>Can I help who's next?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>All right, scramble, jocks!
</p><p>It's time to fly.
</p><p>VANESSA:
</p><p>Thank you, Barry!
</p><p>(Ken walks by on the sidewalk and sees the "bee-approved honey" in
</p><p>Vanessa's shop)
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>That bee is living my life!!
</p><p>ANDY:
</p><p>Let it go, Kenny.
</p><p>KEN:
</p><p>- When will this nightmare end?!
</p><p>ANDY:
</p><p>- Let it all go.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>- Beautiful day to fly.
</p><p>POLLEN JOCK:
</p><p>
</p><p>- Sure is.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>Between you and me,
</p><p>I was dying to get out of that office.
</p><p>(Barry recreates the scene near the beginning of the movie where he flies
</p><p>through the box kite. The movie fades to black and the credits being)
</p><p>[--after credits; No scene can be seen but the characters can be heard
</p><p>talking over the credits--]
</p><p>You have got
</p><p>to start thinking bee, my friend!
</p><p> :
</p><p>- Thinking bee!
</p><p>- Me?
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>(Talking over singer)
</p><p>Hold it. Let's just stop
</p><p>for a second. Hold it.
</p><p> :
</p><p>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
</p><p>Can we stop here?
</p><p>SINGER:
</p><p>Oh, BarryBARRY:
</p><p>I'm not making a major life decision
</p><p>during a production number!
</p><p>SINGER:
</p><p>All right. Take ten, everybody.
</p><p>Wrap it up, guys.
</p><p>BARRY:
</p><p>I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
</p><p>
</p><p></p>
